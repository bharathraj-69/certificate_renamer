### **Basic Idea of the Project**

The Certificate Generator App simplifies creating personalized certificates by automating the process. Users upload:  

1. **A text file** with recipient names (one name per line).  
2. **A certificate template** in PDF format.  

The app combines the names with the template, generates individual certificates, and saves them in the user's **Downloads > MyCertificates** folder.  

This reduces manual work and ensures consistency, making it ideal for events, workshops, or organizations.
